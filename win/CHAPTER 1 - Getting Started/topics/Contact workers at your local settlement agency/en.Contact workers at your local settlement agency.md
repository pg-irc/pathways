When you arrive in Manitoba, you can get help from a settlement agency. Settlement agencies are community organizations that help newcomers. Services are confidential, free of charge and available in many languages. A settlement worker can give you information about different community and government services. You can ask about housing, health care, language training, how to find a job and much more. Settlement agencies have programs that can help you and your family connect to your new community.


The governments of Canada and Manitoba pay these organizations to help newcomers settle into their lives in Manitoba.
